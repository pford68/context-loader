  "readme": "A very small set of utilities for use with JavaScript objects. \nIncludes yet another version of extend() because sometimes an extend() is all you want. \n\n## API Documentation\n### extend(that, varargs)\nJust JQuery's/underscore's extend().  Mixes the properties of all of the arguments after \nthe first parameter into the first parameters.  Takes an arbitrary number of objects as parameters.\n\n### augment(that, props)\nCopies properties from the second object to the first object (that) <strong>iff</strong> the property\ndoes not exist in the first or is null.\n\n### override(that, props)\nCopies properties from the second object to the first iff the property <strong>exists</strong>\nin the first.\n\n### clone(that)\nReturns a deep copy of the specified object\n\n### isObject(that, pure)\nReturns true/false for whether the specified value is an Object, and works for Objects created in other\nframes as well.  If the \"pure\" flag is \"true\" then isObject() should return true only if the value belongs\nexclusively to the Object type, not to any sub-type.\n",
